# ssh-connect

Forked from [gko/ssh-connect](https://github.com/gko/ssh-connect) for use in my dotfiles.
The only changes are [this fix](https://github.com/gko/ssh-connect/issues/6#issuecomment-781914359) by [XpliSyL](https://github.com/XpliSyL) which fixes history searching and a simple rename of the main file so it works with Prezto out of the box.

### Installing with [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)
Clone to your desired directory
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/winkwonkbitch/ssh-connect
```
Add the cloned directory to your _`$ZDOTDIR/.zpreztorc`_
```bash
zstyle ':prezto:load' pmodule-dirs path/to/cloned/directory
```
And finally load the module in _`$ZDOTDIR/.zpreztorc`_
```bash
zstyle ':prezto:load' pmodule 'ssh-connect'
```

### Installing manually
Clone to your desired directory
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/winkwonkbitch/ssh-connect
```
And source the plugin in your _`.zshrc`_
```bash
source /path/to/cloned/directory/ssh-connect.plugin.zsh
```
